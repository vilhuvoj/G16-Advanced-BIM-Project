# G16 Advanced BIM Project

Over the course of five assignments, a Python script was designed to perform a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on a Building Information Model represented in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The code begins by methodically scrutinizing the building model, where it categorizes materials into distinct categories, such as "Slabs" and "Walls," and proceeds to calculate their respective volumes. Following this, the code enhances the IFC model by incorporating material densities and corresponding CO2-equivalents per kilogram of material, sourced from a preexisting database stored in a Microsoft Excel file. Subsequently, the script computes the total weights of all elements and further derives CO2 equivalents for each element. These computed results are methodically structured, documented, and stored in an Excel file. This serves as a pivotal resource for conducting in-depth LCA analyses, allowing for a thorough assessment of the project's environmental impact and sustainability, with a primary focus on material utilization. 

In Assignment 1, we laid the foundation by defining our focus area to be LCA. This involved identifying a use case or problem within our chosen focus area and selecting a Skylab model to work on. We harnessed the power of the IFA tool to convert IFC data into an Excel workbook, creating a dashboard aligned with our selected use case and learning about the structure of IFC files.

Building upon the last assignment, Assignment 2 delved into tool development and a description of our chosen use case. The development of a [Python script](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A4/blob/main/main.py) formed the core of our tool, accompanied by an IFC model (not included due to containing confidential information) to practically apply our solution. A comprehensive markdown file provided insights into the use case, its target audience, the interdisciplinary expertise involved, and visual representations through [BPNM diagram](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A3/blob/main/img/diagram.svg). We also defined the scope of our tool, ensuring clarity on its boundaries.

[Assignment 3](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A3) further extended our journey by planning the development of our tool. The report synthesized elements from Information Delivery Manuals, BIM Execution Plans, and common development methodologies. It included an analysis of our use case's goal, proposed a detailed tool workflow through a [BPNM diagram](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A4/blob/main/img/diagram.svg), and explored the potential business and societal values offered by our tool.

In [Assignment 4](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A4), we transitioned from tool development to knowledge transfer. We developed tutorials to teach advanced BIM concepts, emphasizing the importance of organizational learning. These tutorials, presented through various mediums such as videos, markdown files, and well-commented code, aimed to contribute to the circular education system. Peer feedback during the final session provided valuable insights for improvement.

The journey culminated in [Assignment 5](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A5), where we engaged in reflection on the work we have done over the semester and what we have learned.

Collectively, these assignments wove together a narrative of exploration, development, planning, knowledge transfer, and reflection, providing a holistic view of our journey through the intricacies of BIM. The assignments not only showcased our technical proficiency but also highlighted the broader implications of BIM tools and methodologies on both societal and business levels.
